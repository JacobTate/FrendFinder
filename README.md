The friend finder app is like a dating app.
When You open the app you will see a button and two links the button will take You to a survey.
one link is for the github repo and the other is for the JSON api friend list.
The Survey has two input boxes one for Your Name and one for the link to an image of You There are also ten questions and select options (1-5) for each question.
When You submit the app will check all of the names in the already existing list and pick the nearest fit for You based on the questions You answered.
An alert will pop up and show you the name and image link of the picked match.

Soon the app will be updated to show a box with the name and image of the best match.
